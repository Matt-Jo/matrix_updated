- What do the letters “(CP)” mean?<p>



When the price of an item is <font color="#ff0000"><b>RED</b></font> and has <font color="#ff0000"><b>(CP)</b></font> to the right it means

that we have assigned you a “Custom Price” for this item. Custom

Pricing is customer specific and is lower than the public’s price.<p>



$9.95 – This is how normal prices are displayed<p>



<font color="#ff0000"><b>$7.95 (CP)</b></font> - This is how <font color="#ff0000">“Custom Prices”</font> are displayed.<p>



So when you see items with “Custom Pricing” it means we have given

you special pricing for that item. If you have any questions about your

Custom Pricing or would like to inquire about Custom Pricing for other

Items please <a href="contact_us.php" target="_blank">contact us</a>.
